//& âž¡ Comparison Operatiors
// In JavaScript, comparison operators are used to compare two values. Here are the main comparison operators:

// 1. Equal to ("==") : "this operator checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. if yes, then the condition becomes true."

console.log(5 == 5); // true
console.log(5 == "5"); // 'true , because it does type coercion'

// 2. Not Equal to ("!=") :This operator checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.

console.log(5 != 4); // true
console.log(5 != "5"); // false , because it does type coercion
